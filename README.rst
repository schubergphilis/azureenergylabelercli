Supported authentication types
==============================

Azure CLI
---------

If you are running the Energy Labeler from your local machine, make sure the user you are authenticated as has the `Security Reader` permission or higher.

.. code-block:: bash
 
  az login --tenant 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

Managed Identity
----------------

If you are running the `azureenergylabeler` container in Azure (on ACI, ACA, etc), this is safest and preferred authentication method. 
To make use of Managed Identity authentication for the Energy Labeler, make sure it is enabled on your instance (ACI, Function App, etc):
.. code-block::

  identity: {
      type: 'SystemAssigned'
          
  }


Also make sure you have a role assignment to your instance, `Security Reader` is required.
.. code-block::

  @description('Security Reader role definition')
  var roleDefinitionId = resourceId('microsoft.authorization/roleDefinitions', '39bc4728-0917-49c7-9d2c-d95423bc2eb4')
  
  @description('Assign Security Reader role to the container so it can gather security compliance of the subscription/tenant')
  resource securityReaderAssignment 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2022-04-01' = {
    name: guid(name)
    scope: tenant()
    properties: {
      principalId: containergroup.identity.principalId
      roleDefinitionId: roleDefinitionId
    }
  }

Service Principal credentials
-----------------------------

If you are running the `azureenergylabeler` container outside Azure, you need to authenticate to Azure using Service Principal credentials.
The Service Principal therefore must have `Security Reader` permission assigned to either at Tenant Level or to the subscriptions where Energy Label are calculated.

Service principal with secret
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table:: CLI Arguments table
  :header: "variable name", "value"

  "`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`", "id of an Azure Active Directory application"
  "`AZURE_TENANT_ID`", "id of the application's Azure Active Directory tenant"
  "`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`", "one of the application's client secrets"

Service principal with certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table:: CLI Arguments table
  :header: "variable name", "value"

  "`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`", "id of an Azure Active Directory application"
  "`AZURE_TENANT_ID`", "id of the application's Azure Active Directory tenant"
  "`AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH`", "path to a PEM or PKCS12 certificate file including private key"
  "`AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`", "password of the certificate file, if any"


Installation
============

Pipx
----

.. code-block::

  pipx install azureenergylabelercli
    installed package azureenergylabelercli 1.0.0, installed using Python 3.10.5
    These apps are now globally available
      - azure-energy-labeler
      - azure_energy_labeler_cli.py
  done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨


Examples
========

Calculate energy label for a tenant
-----------------------------------

.. code-block::

  azure-energy-labeler --tenant-id <TENANT_ID>

Calculate energy label for two subscriptions in a tenant
--------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block::

  azure-energy-labeler --tenant-id <TENANT_ID> --allowed-subscription-ids 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000,00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001


Calculate energy label for a tenant and export all findings to a local folder
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block::

  azure-energy-labeler --tenant-id 2ba489e8-3466-4f52-a32d-263d28b832e1 --export-path /tmp/ --export-all


Calculate energy label for a tenant and export all findings to a Storage Account Blob Container
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block::

  azure-energy-labeler --tenant-id 2ba489e8-3466-4f52-a32d-263d28b832e1 --export-path "https://sa.blob.windows.net/container/?sas_token" --export-all


Development Workflow
====================

The workflow supports the following steps

 * lint
 * test
 * build
 * document
 * upload
 * graph

These actions are supported out of the box by the corresponding scripts under _CI/scripts directory with sane defaults based on best practices.
Sourcing setup_aliases.ps1 for windows powershell or setup_aliases.sh in bash on Mac or Linux will provide with handy aliases for the shell of all those commands prepended with an underscore.

The bootstrap script creates a .venv directory inside the project directory hosting the virtual environment. It uses pipenv for that.
It is called by all other scripts before they do anything. So one could simple start by calling _lint and that would set up everything before it tried to actually lint the project

Once the code is ready to be delivered the _tag script should be called accepting one of three arguments, patch, minor, major following the semantic versioning scheme.
So for the initial delivery one would call

    $ _tag --minor

which would bump the version of the project to 0.1.0 tag it in git and do a push and also ask for the change and automagically update HISTORY.rst with the version and the change provided.


So the full workflow after git is initialized is:

 * repeat as necessary (of course it could be test - code - lint :) )

   * code
   * lint
   * test
 * commit and push
 * develop more through the code-lint-test cycle
 * tag (with the appropriate argument)
 * build
 * upload (if you want to host your package in pypi)
 * document (of course this could be run at any point)


Important Information
=====================

This template is based on pipenv. In order to be compatible with requirements.txt so the actual created package can be used by any part of the existing python ecosystem some hacks were needed.
So when building a package out of this **do not** simple call

    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_egg

**as this will produce an unusable artifact with files missing.**
Instead use the provided build and upload scripts that create all the necessary files in the artifact.
